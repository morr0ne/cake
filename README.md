# Cake - The Portal ending screen in your browser

A tribute to one of my favorite games of all time: Portal.

Built on top of web technologies (HTML, JS, and CSS) using Astro as the
underlying framework.

The aim is to build a version that is 100% accurate, or as close to that as
reasonably possible. This is achieved by carefully analyzing the assets of the
original game instead of relying on guesswork like other similar projects.

## Running locally

To run the project locally first ensure you have nodejs version >=18.14.1 with
corepack enabled.

Then after cloning the repository run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

You can then access the site by visiting http://localhost:4321 in your browser.
